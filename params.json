Using [libstokes](http://kichiki.github.com/ryuon/libstokes/), [RYUON-stokes](http://kichiki.github.com/ryuon/stokes/) can solve resistance and mobility problems under the periodic boundary condition with F, FT, and FTS versions for full 3D as well as semi-2D (monolayer) configurations. For each of them, there are two versions, with or without lubrication correction. For mobility problem, also fixed particles can be handled.\r\n\r\n### about RYUON project\r\nRYUON-stokes is a part of [RYUON project](http://kichiki.github.com/ryuon/).\r\n\r\nFor details about RYUON-stokes, go to [RYUON-stokes](http://kichiki.github.com/ryuon/stokes/)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nKengo Ichiki (@kichiki)\r\n\r\n### License\r\nRYUON-stokes project is released under [GNU General Public License, version 2](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
