{"name":"Stokes","tagline":"RYUON-stokes is a Stokesian dynamics simulator","body":"### Welcome to RYUON-stokes Pages.\r\nRYUON-stokes is a Stokesian dynamics simulator. Using libstokes, RYUON-stokes can solve resistance and mobility problems under the periodic boundary condition with F, FT, and FTS versions for full 3D as well as semi-2D (monolayer) configurations. For each of them, there are two versions, with or without lubrication correction. For mobility problem, also fixed particles can be handled.\r\n\r\nAfter your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nKengo Ichiki (@kichiki)\r\n\r\n### License\r\nRYUON-stokes project is released under [GNU General Public License, version 2](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
